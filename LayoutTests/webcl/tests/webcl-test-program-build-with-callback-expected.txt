This test aims to verify if the WebCLCallback is working fine when it is used as argument in WebCLProgram::build. It creates two WebCLProgram objects and each one calls a different WebCLCallback. All callbacks should be invoked except the callback which is associated with a WebCL object that will be released.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS Callback is working fine.
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
